In my case, there was a slight improvement in accuracy of predictions after incorporating LSH in the case 3 item-base CF. In case, where there were no previous reviews for the business, it is difficult to find the other businesses similar to the given one as no-user has rated it yet- cold start problem. In this case using the "0/1" Jaccard similarity and LSh to find similar items provides useful information about businesses similar to current one. These set of businesses augmented the set of businesses generated from item-based CF, hence there were more items contributing to the predicted rating. Thus accuracy improved. Speed of prediction doesn't have a noticeable change.
